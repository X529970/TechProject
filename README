Background

Circulars are a staple of many households as consumers continue to find ways to balance the budget.  Whether resulting from a need to eliminate the deficit created by limited source of income or the need to create more savings for future use,  the interest in and use of circulars are pervasive, especially in the following industries:

1. Grocery and Supermarket shoppers
2. Computer and Electronics
3. Home Improvement
4. Travel and Hotel Destinations



Budget Allocation Model

DI – Disposable Income
Itm – A tangible item desired
Rnk – Hierarchical ranking for the tangible item

Budget Allocation =  DI >= Σ( (Itm1* Cost )+(Itm2* Cost ) + (Itm3* Cost ) ….)
